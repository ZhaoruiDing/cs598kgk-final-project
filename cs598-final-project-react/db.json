      "content": "So let's ask, what exactly defines worth it? \n Is it just money? \n If so, I can suggest many other jobs that earn more that a Computer Scientist (and I will lump in the common business application developer in with that category, who usually makes more salary wise than a researcher or educator). we make a great salary (for those of us who are good at what we do), but not as much as Bill. \n Is it low-stress? \n CS (specifically IT) often tops the list as most stressful jobs in the U.S. You work for managers who live by a date that you can't meet and for customers who don't know enough about applications to be able to concretely tell you all the detailed nuances of application development so you don't end up changing or redoing the app multiple times (scope change). \n It is a constant battle and only the Google's of the world understand enough about the programmers to try to make it fun and creative. The majority of companies tend to assume you are easily replaceable or outsourced. Add to that the stress of competing with an influx of people willing to work harder and for half your wages.",

      "content": "Software engineering and programming jobs represent the typical career path for a computer science major. Nonetheless, careers in computer science evolve at a staggering rate. Job titles like Data Scientist and Big Data Engineer did not exist ten years ago. I can still see growth in data science jobs in the upcoming decade. To be prepared for such jobs, a data scientist needs to master four main skills: \n (1) Programming: a data scientist must be proficient in one or more high level programming languages like C/C++ and Java as well as major scripting languages such as Python and R. \n (2) Database / SQL: a data scientist must be able to manage, maintain, and retrieve data stored in large-scale data databases. Hence, learning SQL, as the most widely-used query language, is also becoming a must. \n (3) Statistics: a data scientist must be able to test various hypotheses on data. She cannot do that without solid understanding of statistical terminology such as Mean, Standard Deviation, P-value, and the Null Hypothesis… \n (4) Machine learning: a data scientist may need to build a machine learning on the input data to predict new unseen patterns. For instance, a data scientist at Netflix may leverage machine learning to predict the next movie you may want to watch. Such prediction model is one of many applications of machine learning theory.",

      "content": "However, considering all these things I would like to categorise this decision making into 3 paths. \n Academic & Research : If you have very good academic results or excellent CGPA, then you would probably be interested in going to Teaching or Research in both Academic and Corporate sectors. If you are interested in Teaching, Research etc then you should just jump into your higher studies as soon as you graduate. If your CGPA is average/below average but you are still want to pursue this career path, then you can probably do some research work with a good professor for a while in your university and have a few good publications. This can be very helpful for the admission into renowned universities for higher studies. Don’t hesitate or waste your time if you want to go for this path. \n Jobs in Software Industry : If you have passion for software development things, you have to find out by yourself what you like most. Development tasks can be boring. So, unless you love what you do, you won’t feel good at your job. If you like Enterprise Software Development, find good companies around you who works in your preferred technologies. If you prefer mobile app development, then find companies that work in such things. Same goes for all other technologies and paths. If you don’t like core development things, then you may like project management, software testing, quality assurance and many other things. And there are many such roles in the companies where you can apply. However, the real problem can happen at another thing. As this is your first job, The big mistake that you might make can be “You go for the job that pays you most” . Believe me on this thing, Never do this. For your first job, Always choose that company which allows you do what you love most and the best possible opportunity to learn. There are many practices in Software Development/Engineering that you may think you know BUT actually you don’t know yet. You may not know how to write good, modular, reusable, testable codes, you may not know best practices of different layers in a good product development, You may not know how to work in a team as a good team member. These things are really important for your career. I have seen many of my friends and juniors do join a few big companies that pays better than others. But unfortunately, soon their job role gets limited to a certain thing within an already established product of that company. Eventually many of them gets frustrated and can not survive long. Those who survives, they eventually moves themselves into other management roles as time goes by. And many of them have to start fresh because of the wrong choice. So in summary, go for the job that you love to do. And think carefully before choosing the right company that helps you grow up to your highest potential. \n Entrepreneurship: This is probably the hardest path to take in my opinion. People may differ and I can’t argue because I didn’t took their path. So, I really don’t know their difficulty levels. However, I’ll only say why I chose this path back in 2013 just after my graduation. I started developing native Android and iOS mobile Apps as freelancer back in 2011 when I was a student. I really loved this work and that time was the rise-up time of Mobile Apps industry. I went to 3 locally reputed companies for job interview at my last semester and got decent job offers from 2 of them. But I wasn’t really happy with the role they chose me for. I wanted to be in Mobile platform & I wanted diversity in my works. That eventually brought Dhrubok Infotech Services Ltd. into existence. Well, I am not super successful entrepreneur in my career yet, But when there are discussions about the top tier talents in iOS and Android in Bangladesh, my name is discussed. If the discussion is about top App development companies, the name “Dhrubok” is discussed among some people. Well, maybe because Bangladesh is a small country :)",

I had extreme dandruff causing hair fall.\nFirst step would be to analyse the reason of your hair fall.\n(PS: if reason for your hair fall is different, solution would be different. I am answering my experience which was due to high dandruff)\n\nThe doctor suggested me of washing my hair daily with a medicated shampoo. She suggested \"8X\" shampoo, but if it is not available, any alternative can be used.\nI have been using the shampoo for 4 years now.\n\nBefore using this shampoo, my hair used to look dry and I applied more oil on that. The doctor told me that the condition is due to a fungus which survives on the oil and suggested me to stop applying oil immediately. It didn't looked correct in the first go, but now it has been 4 years since I applied any oil, and my hair look much healthier. In fact, by the end of the day natural oil secreted by my scalp makes my hair look oiled.\n\nDiet:\n\nHaving antioxidant rich food helps in healthy hair growth, it includes fruits, green vegetables , green tea and Flax seeds.\n\nHaving proteins rich foods like soya bean, milk, white meat (fish/chicken) provide ingredients for hair growth.\n\nExercise:\nYes, they have an exercise for hair too.\nIncrease in hair growth can be simulated by massaging and activating scalp cells. Doing neck exercises. However I do that only occasionally as I am lazy.",
